I started my journey with CCNA on 2025-11-25 after attaining Huawei Information Communication Associate - Datacom certificate. As I did not have hands-on experience in Huawei eNSP, I realized that having knowledge in networking does not equate to knowing how to implement it. Therefore, I am dedicating my time to Cisco Packet Tracer to learn and implement networking concepts in Cisco products.

Whenever I encounter issues or have questions, I use Gemini AI to help me learn deeper and understand the concepts better.
